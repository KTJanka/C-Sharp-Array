Student Array

With this program I ran into issues with the arrayNumber int not wanting to increase in size or skipping over numbers.
I realized that I had the array++ in the wrong button, with it being under the display button it cause it to run the loop instantly and skipped right to the max size.
After moving this to the right section of code the array incremented properly. I checked multiple values and everything worked as intended.
